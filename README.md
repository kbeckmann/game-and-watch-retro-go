# How to report issues

:exclamation: Please read this before reporting issues.

You may run the script `./report_issue.sh` and follow the steps lined out, or continue reading:

Please include the following:

- Which console (NES or GB)
- The full name of the ROM you are running, e.g. "Super_Tilt_Bro_(E).nes"
- The git hash of this repo and the submodule. Run the following: `git describe --all --long --dirty=-dirty; cd retro-go-stm32; git describe --all --long --dirty=-dirty`

With this information, please head over to the [Discord](https://discord.gg/vVcwrrHTNJ) and post in the #support channel. If you don't want to use discord for some reason, please create an issue.


## Troubleshooting

- Do you have any changed files, even if you didn't intentionally change them? Please run `git reset --hard` to ensure an unchanged state.
- Did you pull but forgot to update the submodule? Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to ensure that the submodules are in sync.
- Always run `make -f Makefile.nes -j clean` or `make -f Makefile.gb -j clean` before building something new. The makefile should handle incremental builds, but please do this first before reporting issues.
- It is still not working? Try the classic trouble shooting methods: Disconnect power to your debugger and G&W and connect again. Try programming the [Base](https://github.com/ghidraninja/game-and-watch-base) project first to ensure you can actually program your device.
- Still not working? Ok, head over to #support on the discord and let's see what's going on.


# Common building steps

- In order to run this on a Nintendo® Game & Watch™ [you need to first unlock it](https://github.com/ghidraninja/game-and-watch-backup/).
- Clone this repo with submodules: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/kbeckmann/game-and-watch-retro-go`
- Clone and build `https://github.com/ghidraninja/game-and-watch-flashloader`. The 'game-and-watch-flashloader' folder must be placed in the same dir as 'game-and-watch-retro-go' folder.

If you are a user who just wants to build and run:
- `cd game-and-watch-retro-go` if you're not already in the game-and-watch-retro-go directory.
- Run `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeH7 && ln -s STM32CubeH7/Drivers Drivers`. This will take a while.


If you are a developer:
- Generate HAL and support files by opening `gw_retrogo.ioc` in `stm32cubemx` and press the `Generate` button. This will however change a couple of files, so run `git reset --hard` to recover the original contents.


## GB

- Follow the common steps above
- Import a GB ROM file: `./update_gb_rom.sh my_rom.gb`
- Build `make -f Makefile.gb -j`

- Program internal flash `make -f Makefile.gb flash`
